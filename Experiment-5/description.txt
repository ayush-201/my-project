Project Summary: Dynamic Product Filtering Tool

This project demonstrates a simple Product Filter application created using HTML and JavaScript.
It allows users to add products with information such as ID, Name, Price, and Category.
Once products are added, they can be filtered through a dropdown menu, which updates automatically whenever a new category is introduced.

Structure of the Webpage (HTML)
The page is organized inside a main <div class="container"> and has three key sections:
Product Entry Form
Heading: “Enter Product Details”
Four input fields:
Product ID
Product Name
Price
Category
A button labeled Add Product, which calls the addProduct() function.

Category Filter
Heading: “Filter by Category”
A <select> element with the ID categoryDropdown
Always includes an All option to show every product.

Product Display Area
Heading: “Product List”
A <div> with ID productList that dynamically shows the products.
Logic of the Application (JavaScript)

Adding Products (addProduct)
Reads values from the input fields.
Checks that no field is left empty.
Creates a product object and pushes it into the products[] array.
Updates the category dropdown and refreshes the product list.
Clears the input fields for new entries.

Updating Categories (updateCategoryDropdown)
Extracts all unique categories from the current product list.
Rebuilds the dropdown while keeping “All” as the default option.

Filtering Products (filterProducts)
Displays products based on the category selected.
If “All” is chosen, products are grouped by their categories.
Handles empty cases by showing suitable messages.

Clearing Inputs (clearInputs)
Resets all form fields after a product is successfully added.

Initial Behavior
When the page loads, filterProducts() runs immediately.
If no products exist, the message “No products added yet.” is displayed.

Key Takeaways
Updating webpage content dynamically using JavaScript DOM methods.
Representing products as objects stored in an array.
Implementing filtering logic to display category-wise results.
Building a small system that refreshes automatically without page reloads.
