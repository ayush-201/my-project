Project Summary: Basic Canvas Drawing Application

This project focuses on building a simple drawing program using the HTML <canvas> element, styled with CSS, and controlled through JavaScript.
It allows users to sketch freely on the canvas by clicking and dragging their mouse.

The functionality is achieved by handling mouse events (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup, and mouseout) so that the drawing appears smooth and continuous.

Webpage Layout (HTML)
The page contains two primary sections:

Title Section
A <h3> heading with the text “SVG Drawing Tool”.

Drawing Section
A <canvas> element with the ID drawingCanvas.
The canvas is 600 × 400 pixels and serves as the drawing surface.
The logic of the app is included within a <script> block at the bottom of the HTML page.

Styling the Page (CSS)
Body
The page is centered horizontally and vertically using Flexbox (display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;).
The height of the body spans the entire screen (100vh).

Canvas
A 2px solid black border makes the drawing area clearly visible.
The background is set to a light grey shade (#f9f9f9).
Program Logic (JavaScript)

Initialization
The canvas is selected with getElementById.
A 2D drawing context is obtained using getContext("2d").
Variables (isDrawing, lastX, lastY) track whether the mouse is pressed and the last cursor position.

Mouse Events
mousedown: Activates drawing mode and records the starting point.
mousemove: Draws lines continuously while the mouse is pressed.
mouseup: Stops drawing when the button is released.
mouseout: Ends drawing if the cursor leaves the canvas area.

Drawing Process
beginPath() starts a fresh path.
moveTo(lastX, lastY) moves to the previous cursor position.
lineTo(e.offsetX, e.offsetY) creates a line to the current position.
stroke() renders the line on the canvas.
The lines are styled blue with a 2px width.

Key Learnings
Using the <canvas> element to create interactive graphics.
Handling mouse actions (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup, mouseout) for user interaction.
Applying drawing methods (beginPath(), moveTo(), lineTo(), stroke()).
Updating a web page dynamically without reloading.
Integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a functional drawing app.
