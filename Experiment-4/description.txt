This project is a simple web-based Live Character Counter designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The program captures the user’s input from a textarea and dynamically updates the total number of characters typed (spaces included).

HTML (Page Layout)
The HTML file mainly has two components: a container <div> and a <script> section.

Container <div>
Displays the page title: "Live Character Counter".
Provides a textarea (with id="txtData") where users can input text, along with a placeholder as guidance.
Includes another <div> with the class counter that shows the live count of typed characters.

Script Section
JavaScript is written inside the <script> tag.
An event listener (input) is added to the textarea so the code runs whenever the user types.
The script retrieves the entered text using textarea.value.length and updates the span (with id="counter") to reflect the new character count.

CSS (Design & Styling)
The webpage design is handled through CSS:

Body
Uses Arial, sans-serif font.
Adds a margin of 10px for spacing.

Textarea
Set to occupy full width of the viewport (width: 100%).
Larger, readable font size (18px).
Added padding of 10px for a better user experience.
Enabled box-sizing: border-box to ensure padding doesn’t affect layout.

Counter (.counter)
Displays bold text.
Adds small spacing above (margin-top: 5px).

Box (.box)
Outlined with a 2px solid black border.
Provides internal padding of 10px.
Includes margin-bottom: 20px for separation.
Restricts maximum width to 500px for cleaner structure.

Key Learnings:
Gained hands-on experience in JavaScript basics like variable usage and DOM updates.
